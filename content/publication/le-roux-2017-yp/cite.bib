 abstract = {Abstract Taxonomy provides a universal method to classify
biodiversity at different scales locally and globally.
Currently, existing taxonomic treatments are scattered, limiting
their accessibility and utility. The Convention on Biological
Diversity has responded to this challenge by setting the goal of
compiling a World Flora Online (Global Strategy for Plant
Conservation Target 1, 2011?2020). This can be done by
aggregating electronically available information provided by
each country, region or specialist group. Developing a Flora or
a high-level monographic product requires time and input from a
large pool of taxonomic specialists. Completing a Flora may be
difficult to accomplish for phytodiverse countries, such as
South Africa, if the 2020 target is to be met. Fortunately, a
large number of taxonomic contributions and many electronic
tools exist that can enhance progress. Where these are
available, efforts have to be made to access and digitise the
literature. Here we describe a pragmatic approach to developing
an online Flora, involving taking floristic information from
multiple, previously published sources, digitising the legacy
literature where needed and aggregating the required information
into a single portal. South Africa is committed to producing an
online Flora (the e-Flora of South Africa) and contributing the
information to the World Flora Online initiative following the
aggregator portal approach, a method described here that might
be useful for other countries with high phytodiversity.},
