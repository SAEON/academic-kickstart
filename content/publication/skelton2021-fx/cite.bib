  abstract = "Quantitative knowledge of xylem physical tolerance limits to
              dehydration is essential to understanding plant drought tolerance
              but is lacking in many long-vessel angiosperms. We examine the
              hypothesis that a fundamental association between sustained xylem
              water transport and downstream tissue function should select for
              xylem that avoids embolism in long-vessel trees by quantifying
              xylem capacity to withstand air entry of western North American
              oaks (Quercus spp.). Optical visualization showed that 50\% of
              embolism occurs at water potentials below -2.7 MPa in all 19
              species, and -6.6 MPa in the most resistant species. By mapping
              the evolution of xylem vulnerability to embolism onto a
              fossil-dated phylogeny of the western North American oaks, we
              found large differences between clades (sections) while closely
              related species within each clade vary little in their capacity
              to withstand air entry. Phylogenetic conservatism in xylem
              physical tolerance, together with a significant correlation
              between species distributions along rainfall gradients and their
              dehydration tolerance, suggests that closely related species
              occupy similar climatic niches and that species' geographic
              ranges may have shifted along aridity gradients in accordance
              with their physical tolerance. Such trends, coupled with
              evolutionary associations between capacity to withstand xylem
              embolism and other hydraulic-related traits, yield wide margins
              of safety against embolism in oaks from diverse habitats. Evolved
              responses of the vascular system to aridity support the embolism
              avoidance hypothesis and reveal the importance of quantifying
              plant capacity to withstand xylem embolism for understanding
              function and biogeography of some of the Northern Hemisphere's
              most ecologically and economically important plants.",
