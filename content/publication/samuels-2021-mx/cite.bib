  abstract  = "Legislation and policy are key tools used by governments to
               change the socio-economic and political landscape of agrarian
               systems with consequences for mobile pastoralism. This study
               used the social-ecological systems framework to examine how
               pastoral mobility in the semi-arid, montane communal rangeland
               in South Africa adapted to the changing socio-political
               landscape. It analysed the impact of apartheid and democratic
               era legislation and policies over the past 70 years. Apartheid
               legislation promoted betterment planning and the privatisation
               of communal lands by awarding access to most of the grazing
               areas to a few wealthier pastoralists. This led to increased
               stocking densities and further restriction of herd mobility when
               the majority of herds were restricted to fewer grazing camps.
               Democratic era land reform policies continue to advocate for the
               modernisation and sedentarisation of pastoral practices. The
               persistence of mobility among livestock keepers despite
               discriminatory policy interventions suggests that this is a
               particularly resilient and necessary element of their practices.
               We argue that agricultural legislation and policies regarding
               livestock farming should promote landscape connectivity to allow
               mobile pastoralists to access variable resources. Connected
               landscapes should be viewed as alternative ways to modernising
               pastoralism and these should prevent elite capture when the land
               is subdivided.",
