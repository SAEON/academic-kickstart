 abstract = {Human activities affect fire in many ways, often unintentionally
or with considerable time-lags before they manifest themselves.
Anticipating these changes is critical, so that insidious impacts
on ecosystems, their biodiversity and associated goods and
services can be avoided, mitigated or managed. Here we explore
the impact of anthropogenic land cover change on fire and
biodiversity in adjacent ecosystems on the hyperdiverse Cape
Peninsula, South Africa. We develop a conceptual framework based
on the notion of an ignition catchment, or the spatial extent and
temporal range where an ignition is likely to result in a site
burning. We apply this concept using fire models to estimate
spatial changes in burn probability between historical and
current land cover. This change layer was used to predict the
observed record of fires and forest encroachment into
fire-dependent Fynbos ecosystems in Table Mountain National Park.
Urban expansion has created anthropogenic fire shadows that are
modifying fire return intervals, facilitating a state shift to
low-diversity, non-flammable forest at the expense of
hyperdiverse, flammable Fynbos ecosystems. Despite occurring in a
conservation area, these ecosystems are undergoing a hidden
collapse and desperately require management intervention.
Anthropogenic fire shadows can be caused by many human activities
and are likely to be a universal phenomenon, not only
contributing to the observed global decline in fire activity but
also causing extreme fires in ecosystems where there is no shift
to a less flammable state and flammable fuels accumulate. The
ignition catchment framework is highly flexible and allows
detection or prediction of changes in the fire regime, the threat
this poses for ecosystems or fire risk and areas where management
interventions and/or monitoring are required. Identifying
anthropogenic impacts on ignition catchments is key for both
understanding global impacts of humans on fire and guiding
management of human-altered landscapes for desirable outcomes.},
