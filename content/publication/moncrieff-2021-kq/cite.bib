  abstract  = "Land cover change is the leading cause of global biodiversity
               decline. New satellite platforms allow for monitoring of
               habitats in increasingly fine detail, but most applications have
               been limited to forested ecosystems. I demonstrate the potential
               for detailed mapping and accurate dating of land cover change
               events in a highly biodiverse, Critically Endangered, shrubland
               ecosystem---the Renosterveld of South Africa. Using supervised
               classification of Sentinel 2 data, and subsequent manual
               verification with very high resolution imagery, I locate all
               conversion of Renosterveld to non-natural land cover between
               2016 and 2020. Land cover change events are further assigned
               dates using high temporal frequency data from Planet labs. A
               total area of 478.6 hectares of Renosterveld loss was observed
               over this period, accounting for 0.72\% of the remaining natural
               vegetation in the region. In total, 50\% of change events were
               dated to within two weeks of their actual occurrence, and 87\%
               to within two months. The Renosterveld loss identified here is
               almost entirely attributable to conversion of natural vegetation
               to cropland through ploughing. Change often preceded the
               planting and harvesting seasons of rainfed annual grains. These
               results show the potential for new satellite platforms to
               accurately map land cover change in non-forest ecosystems, and
               detect change within days of its occurrence. There is potential
               to use this and similar datasets to automate the process of
               change detection and monitor change continuously.",
