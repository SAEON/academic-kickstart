 abstract = {Conversion of natural ecosystems into anthropogenic landscapes
can result in biotic homogenization, whereby differences in
species composition among sites are diminished through
colonization or local extinction. This may reduce the resilience
of assemblages to further perturbation and the range or quality
of ecosystem services they offer.},
