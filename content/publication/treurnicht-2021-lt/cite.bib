 abstract = {Abstract 1. The ecological effects of harvesting from wild
populations are often uncertain, especially since the
sensitivity of populations to harvesting can vary across
species? geographical ranges. In the Cape Floristic Region (CFR,
South Africa) biodiversity hotspot, wildflower harvesting is
widespread and economically important, providing an income to
many rural communities. However, with very few species studied
to date, and without considering range-wide sensitivity to
harvesting, there is limited information available to ensure the
sustainability of wildflower harvesting. 2. We studied
geographical variation in sensitivity to wildflower harvesting
for 26 Proteaceae shrubs with fire-driven life cycles using
population viability analyses. We developed stochastic,
density-dependent population models that were parameterized from
individual demographic rates (adult fecundity, seedling
recruitment and adult fire survival) and local environmental
conditions across the geographical ranges of the study species.
We then simulated the effects of harvesting on populations in
different environments across species ranges. Our model
simulations predicted extinction risk per population, and we
derived extinction probabilities over 100 years in response to
different harvesting regimes. We used these population-level
extinction probabilities to quantify inter- and intraspecific
variation in sensitivity to wildflower harvesting, and to
explore how geographical variation in sensitivity depends on
environmental conditions (climate, soil fertility and fire
disturbance). 3. We detected considerable inter- and
intraspecific variation in sensitivity to wildflower harvesting
for the 26 study species. This held for both ?nonsprouters? and
?resprouters? (species with low and high fire persistence
ability, respectively). Intraspecific variation in sensitivity
to harvesting showed varying geographical patterns and
associated with environmental variation. Notably, sensitivity
was high towards range edges and at the climatic extremes of
species ranges, respectively. 4. Synthesis and applications: We
show the importance of combining spatial demographic data,
density-dependent population dynamics and environmental
variation when assessing sensitivity to harvesting across
species geographical ranges. Our findings caution against the
application of general harvesting guidelines irrespective of
species, geographical location or local environmental
conditions. Our range-wide population viability analyses provide
insights for developing species-specific, spatially nuanced
guidelines for conservation management. Our approach also
identifies species and areas to prioritise for monitoring to
prevent the overexploitation of harvested species.},
