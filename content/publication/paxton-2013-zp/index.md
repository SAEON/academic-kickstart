abstract: "This study tested the hypothesis that growth increments in larval largemouth yellowfish Labeobarbus kimberleyensis and smallmouth yellowfish L. aeneus from the Orange--Vaal river system, South Africa, are deposited daily. The periodicity of increment formation was determined by regular sampling and counting of increments deposited in the otoliths collected from a total of 52 smallmouth and 41 largemouth laboratory-reared larvae. Increments were counted using a compound light microscope under transmitted light at 100 â€¦"
