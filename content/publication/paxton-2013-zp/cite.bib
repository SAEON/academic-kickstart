 abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that growth increments in
larval largemouth yellowfish Labeobarbus kimberleyensis and
smallmouth yellowfish L. aeneus from the Orange--Vaal river
system, South Africa, are deposited daily. The periodicity of
increment formation was determined by regular sampling and
counting of increments deposited in the otoliths collected from
a total of 52 smallmouth and 41 largemouth laboratory-reared
larvae. Increments were counted using a compound light
microscope under transmitted light at 100 â€¦},
