  abstract = "The stable isotopes of water (18O, 2H) and other hydrochemical
              properties were used to assess seasonal changes between sources
              of stream water and flow pathways in baseflow conditions for two
              headwater sub-catchments (âˆ¼3 km2) of the Jonkershoek, a
              mountainous catchment in the Western Cape of South Africa. The
              sub-catchments differ in land cover, one is dominated by
              indigenous fynbos vegetation and the other by pine plantation.
              Stream water, higher elevation springs, and lower elevation
              groundwater samples were collected monthly from January 2018 to
              January 2019, and were analysed for stable isotopes, electrical
              conductivity (EC) and pH. The stream water isotopic values
              resembled those of groundwater during the dry and wet seasons.
              Results indicated a steady contribution of spring discharge to
              streams during the dry season, with rainfall contribution less
              evident. Wet season flows were attributed to interflow including
              perennial and ephemeral springs. Spatial variations in EC between
              the sub-catchments were indicative of a greater proportional
              input from subsurface water, more evaporation and/or more mineral
              dissolution in the pine-dominated sub-catchment. The
              spatiotemporal variability in EC was significantly larger than
              for the stable isotopes. These findings enabled conceptualization
              of streamflow generation processes that can support strategic
              water resource management practices in this region.",
