 abstract = {Biodiversity affects ecosystem function through species'
functional traits. Although it is possible to predict species
richness (SR) patterns along environmental gradients, whether
functional diversity (FD) changes in predictable ways is not
known. In arid environments, SR typically increases with
rainfall. Aridity may limit functional differentiation by
allowing only certain traits, but could also be associated with
diverse traits associated with various strategies for coping
with spatial and temporal variation in resources. Rare species
