 abstract = {Motivation: The BioTIME database contains raw data on species
identities and abundances in ecological assemblages through
time. These data enable users to calculate temporal trends in
biodiversity within and amongst assemblages using a broad range
of metrics. BioTIME is being developed as a community-led
open-source database of biodiversity time series. Our goal is to
accelerate and facilitate quantitative analysis of temporal
patterns of biodiversity in the Anthropocene. Main types of
variables included: The database contains 8,777,413 species
abundance records, from assemblages consistently sampled for a
minimum of 2 years, which need not necessarily be consecutive.
In addition, the database contains metadata relating to sampling
methodology and contextual information about each record.
Spatial location and grain: BioTIME is a global database of
547,161 unique sampling locations spanning the marine,
freshwater and terrestrial realms. Grain size varies across
datasets from 0.0000000158 km2 (158 cm2) to 100 km2
(1,000,000,000,000 cm2). Time period and grain: BioTIME records
span from 1874 to 2016. The minimal temporal grain across all
datasets in BioTIME is a year. Major taxa and level of
measurement: BioTIME includes data from 44,440 species across
the plant and animal kingdoms, ranging from plants, plankton and
terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates.
