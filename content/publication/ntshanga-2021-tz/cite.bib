 abstract = {Abstract Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are amongst the
major drivers of biodiversity loss globally. Although habitat
fragmentation poses additional threats to biodiversity beyond
habitat loss alone, the IUCN?s Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) does
not provide guidance on how to assess these threats. This study
develops an approach for incorporating habitat fragmentation
into the RLE threat assessment and investigates additional
insights such an analysis could provide beyond the analysis of
distribution trends. This is achieved by quantifying RLE
criteria A and B (distribution reduction, restricted
distribution and decline) and comparing outcomes with indices of
habitat fragmentation (core area, Largest Patch Index, Patch
Cohesion Index and Aggregation Index) in the Cape Floristic
Region of South Africa. Results revealed that much of the Cape
Floristic Region is severely threatened by both landscape
transformation and habitat fragmentation, but that treating the
habitat fragmentation indices as additional RLE criteria did not
alter the ecosystem threat assessment outcomes. Whilst this
suggests that the existing RLE criteria implicitly account for
habitat fragmentation, the relationship between fragmentation
indices and RLE criteria were weak and highly variable in some
cases, indicating that the RLE criteria alone do not
sufficiently account for the threat of habitat fragmentation.
Supplementing the RLE with habitat fragmentation measures
highlights additional, unique information on threats to
ecosystems. This simple approach has the potential to assist in
setting conservation priorities and management goals,
particularly in fragmented ecosystems.},
