 abstract = {Monitoring of species and populations is essential for
biodiversity observation and reporting at local, national and
global scales, but can be an exceedingly difficult task for
many, if not most, species. We tested the viability of using
Google Earth™ imagery to manually map and monitor all
individuals of the critically endangered Clanwilliam cedar,
Widdringtonia wallichii Endl. ex Carrière, across its global
native distribution; the remote and rugged Cederberg mountains.
Comparison with sampling from field surveys reveals this to be a
highly efficient and effective method for mapping healthy adult
tree localities, but it fails to detect small or unhealthy
individuals with green canopies <4 m2, or discern the number of
individuals in clumps. This approach is clearly viable as a
monitoring tool for this species and, with the rapid progress
being made in machine learning approaches and satellite
technology, will only become easier and more feasible for a
greater number of species in the near future. Sadly, our field
surveys revealed that the number of trees that have recently
died (dead leaves still present) outnumbered live trees by a
ratio of 2:1.},
