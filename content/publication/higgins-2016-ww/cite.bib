 abstract = {Biomes are important constructs for organizing understanding of
how the worlds' major terrestrial ecosystems differ from one
another and for monitoring change in these ecosystems. Yet
existing biome classification schemes have been criticized for
being overly subjective and for explicitly or implicitly invoking
climate. We propose a new biome map and classification scheme
that uses information on (i) an index of vegetation productivity,
(ii) whether the minimum of vegetation activity is in the driest
or coldest part of the year, and (iii) vegetation height.
Although biomes produced on the basis of this classification show
a strong spatial coherence, they show little congruence with
existing biome classification schemes. Our biome map provides an
alternative classification scheme for comparing the
biogeochemical rates of terrestrial ecosystems. We use this new
biome classification scheme to analyse the patterns of biome
change observed over recent decades. Overall, 13% to 14% of
analysed pixels shifted in biome state over the 30-year study
period. A wide range of biome transitions were observed. For
example, biomes with tall vegetation and minimum vegetation
activity in the cold season shifted to higher productivity biome
states. Biomes with short vegetation and low seasonality shifted
to seasonally moisture-limited biome states. Our findings and
method provide a new source of data for rigorously monitoring
global vegetation change, analysing drivers of vegetation change
and for benchmarking models of terrestrial ecosystem function.},
