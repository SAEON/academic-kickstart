 abstract = {The development of frameworks for better-understanding
ecological syndromes and putative evolutionary strategies of
plant adaptation to fire has recently received a flurry of
attention, including a new model hypothesizing that plants have
diverged into three different plant flammability strategies due
to natural selection. We provide three case studies of
pyromes/taxa (Pinus, the Proteaceae of the Cape Floristic
Region, and Eucalyptus) that, contrary to model assumptions,
reveal that plant species often exhibit traits of more than one
of these flammability and post-fire recovery strategies. We
propose that such multiple-strategy adaptations have been
favoured as bet-hedging strategies in response to selective
pressure from mixed-fire regimes experienced by these species
over evolutionary time.},
