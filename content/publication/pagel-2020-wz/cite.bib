 abstract = {Forecasts of global change impacts on biodiversity often assume
that the current geographical distributions of species match
their ecological niches. Here we examine this assumption using
an extensive dataset of large-scale variation in demographic
rates that enables us to quantify demography-based ecological
niches of 26 plant species. Contrasting these niches with the
species' geographic distributions reveals that
niche--distribution mismatches can be large and depend on key
life-history traits: poorly dispersed species are absent from
suitable sites, and species with high persistence ability are
present in sites that are currently unsuitable for them. Such
niche--distribution mismatches need to be accounted for to
improve forecasts of biodiversity dynamics under environmental
change. The ecological niche of a species describes the
variation in population growth rates along environmental
gradients that drives geographic range dynamics. Niches are thus
central for understanding and forecasting species' geographic
distributions. However, theory predicts that migration
limitation, source--sink dynamics, and time-lagged local
extinction can cause mismatches between niches and geographic
distributions. It is still unclear how relevant these
niche--distribution mismatches are for biodiversity dynamics and
how they depend on species life-history traits. This is mainly
due to a lack of the comprehensive, range-wide demographic data
needed to directly infer ecological niches for multiple species.
Here we quantify niches from extensive demographic measurements
along environmental gradients across the geographic ranges of 26
plant species (Proteaceae; South Africa). We then test whether
life history explains variation in species' niches and
niche--distribution mismatches. Niches are generally wider for
species with high seed dispersal or persistence abilities.
Life-history traits also explain the considerable interspecific
variation in niche--distribution mismatches: poorer dispersers
are absent from larger parts of their potential geographic
ranges, whereas species with higher persistence ability more
frequently occupy environments outside their ecological niche.
Our study thus identifies major demographic and functional
determinants of species' niches and geographic distributions. It
highlights that the inference of ecological niches from
geographical distributions is most problematic for poorly
dispersed and highly persistent species. We conclude that the
direct quantification of ecological niches from demographic
responses to environmental variation is a crucial step toward a
better predictive understanding of biodiversity dynamics under
environmental change.},
