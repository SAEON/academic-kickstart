 abstract = {How the relative importance of community assembly processes
varies with spatial scale is the focus of intensive debate, in
part because inferring the scales at which specific niche-based
processes act is difficult. One obstacle is that standard
phylogenetic and functional diversity metrics may integrate the
signals of multiple processes when combining separate niche axes
into one variable (multiple-niche-axis metrics), potentially
obscuring overlapping niche-based processes. We use simulations
to evaluate the power of these metrics to detect competition and
habitat filtering when these processes operate across multiple
niche axes and vary in their relative importance. We then test
for both processes at a range of spatial scales in a Neotropical
bird assemblage. Simulations revealed that multiple-niche-axis
metrics had low power to detect competition and habitat filtering
when a mix of both processes acts across niche axes, whereas
metrics focused on single-niche axes were better able to deal
with this complexity. We found the same contrast in bird
communities, where both competition and habitat filtering were
detected at the scale of individual territories, but only by
single-niche-axis metrics focused on specific niche axes (e.g.,
foraging traits). Our results suggest that multiple-niche-axis
metrics may produce misleading evidence that niche-based
processes are partitioned, particularly across scales, and
highlight the importance of analyzing functional diversity
patterns on individual niche axes when testing assembly models.},
