 abstract = {Abstract The Jonkershoek Forestry Research Station was
established in the Mediterranean climate region of South Africa
in 1935 to implement a multiple catchment experiment to
determine the effects of afforestation on water yield. The
experiment consists of six neighbouring catchments previously
supporting indigenous fynbos shrublands, five of which were
sequentially afforested with Pinus radiata plantations every
8?years from 1940 to 1980 and one kept as the control. They
conclusively demonstrated a significant impact of afforestation
on streamflow. The treatment catchments have seen subsequent
plantation rotations since 1980 and rainfall and streamflow
observations have been continued to date. Here we describe the
site, experimental design, rainfall and streamflow records,
instrumentation, and how to access the data. We also provide
details of recently installed instrumentation, including full
weather stations, fog gauges, and an eddy covariance flux tower.
The Jonkershoek catchment experiment was the core of a globally
significant interdisciplinary research programme (1935?1992)
that shaped most environmental policies and practices relating
to biodiversity, forestry, fire and water in South Africa and
beyond. The South African Environmental Observation Network
(SAEON) inherited the experiment in 2010 and is maintaining it
as a long-term eco-hydrological research platform and global
change observatory.},
