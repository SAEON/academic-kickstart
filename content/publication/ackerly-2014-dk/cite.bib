 abstract = {The world's mediterranean-climate regions all have mild,
winter-rain climates that have developed over the past several
million years, but beyond these similarities they have distinct
geological and evolutionary histories that have shaped the
floras of each region. This chapter considers the historical and
regional influences that have shaped the floras of MT regions,
focusing on South Africa, California and Western Australia. One
of the most striking differences is their positions on the
respective continents, and their tectonic history, and the
absence of a high latitude, terrestrial region bordering South
Africa and Australia. As a result, the Cape flora does not have
a clearly identified temperate element, in striking contrast
with California, and this may contribute to the high level of
in-situ radiation in Cape lineages. While radiations have
occurred in the sclerophyllous lineages in both areas, the
moist-adapted, forest communities tend to be derived from
cool-temperate lineages in California and from warm,
afrotropical lineages in South Africa. In both cases, these
components of the flora represent greater phylogenetic
diversity. The absence of temperate land masses adjacent to
South Africa and Western Australia result in greater reduction
in the area of mediterranean-type climate in the face of 21st
century global warming. Other aspects of geology, topography and
human land-use impacting the prospects for biodiversity
conservation are addressed.},
