 abstract = {Daily activity schedules and time budgets reveal how animals
cope with changing environmental conditions in securing food and
evading enemies. Theory suggests that animals in populations
limited by food availability should be energy maximizers in
their foraging time allocation, while those regulated by
predation should minimize their mobile activity levels. We

three species of grazing ungulates coexisting in the same region
