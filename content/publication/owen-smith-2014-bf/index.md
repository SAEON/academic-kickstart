abstract: "Daily activity schedules and time budgets reveal how animals cope with changing environmental conditions in securing food and evading enemies. Theory suggests that animals in populations limited by food availability should be energy maximizers in their foraging time allocation, while those regulated by predation should minimize their mobile activity levels. We compared daily and seasonal variation in activity states among three species of grazing ungulates coexisting in the same region of K ruger N ational P ark, S outh â€¦"
