 abstract = {Abstract Aim Tree crowns determine light interception, carbon
and water exchange. Thus, understanding the factors causing tree
crown allometry to vary at the tree and stand level matters
greatly for the development of future vegetation modelling and
for the calibration of remote sensing products. Nevertheless, we
know little about large-scale variation and determinants in
tropical tree crown allometry. In this study, we explored the
continental variation in scaling exponents of site-specific
crown allometry and assessed their relationships with
environmental and stand-level variables in the tropics. Location
Global tropics. Time period Early 21st century. Major taxa
studied Woody plants. Methods Using a dataset of 87,737 trees
distributed among 245 forest and savanna sites across the
tropics, we fitted site-specific allometric relationships
between crown dimensions (crown depth, diameter and volume) and
stem diameter using power-law models. Stand-level and
environmental drivers of crown allometric relationships were
assessed at pantropical and continental scales. Results The
scaling exponents of allometric relationships between stem
diameter and crown dimensions were higher in savannas than in
forests. We identified that continental crown models were better
than pantropical crown models and that continental differences
in crown allometric relationships were driven by both
stand-level (wood density) and environmental (precipitation,
cation exchange capacity and soil texture) variables for both
tropical biomes. For a given diameter, forest trees from Asia
and savanna trees from Australia had smaller crown dimensions
than trees in Africa and America, with crown volumes for some
Asian forest trees being smaller than those of trees in African
forests. Main conclusions Our results provide new insight into
geographical variability, with large continental differences in
tropical tree crown allometry that were driven by stand-level
and environmental variables. They have implications for the
assessment of ecosystem function and for the monitoring of woody
biomass by remote sensing techniques in the global tropics.},
