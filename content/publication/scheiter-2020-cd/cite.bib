 abstract = {Abstract. Current rates of climate and atmospheric change are
likely higher than during the last millions of years. Even
higher rates of change are projected in CMIP5 climate model
ensemble runs for some Representative Concentration Pathway
(RCP) scenarios. The speed of ecological processes such as leaf
physiology, demography or migration can differ from the speed of
changes in environmental conditions. Such mismatches imply lags
between the actual vegetation state and the vegetation state
expected under prevailing environmental conditions. Here, we
used a dynamic vegetation model, the adaptive Dynamic Global
Vegetation Model (aDGVM), to study lags between actual and
expected vegetation in Africa under a changing atmospheric CO2
mixing ratio. We hypothesized that lag size increases with a
more rapidly changing CO2 mixing ratio as opposed to slower
changes in CO2 and that disturbance by fire further increases
lag size. Our model results confirm these hypotheses, revealing
lags between vegetation state and environmental conditions and
enhanced lags in fire-driven systems. Biome states, carbon
stored in vegetation and tree cover in Africa are most sensitive
to changes in CO2 under recent and near-future levels. When
averaged across all biomes and simulations with and without
fire, times to reach an equilibrium vegetation state increase
from approximately 242 years for 200 ppm to 898 years for 1000
ppm. These results have important implications for vegetation
modellers and for policy making. Lag effects imply that
vegetation will undergo substantial changes in distribution
patterns, structure and carbon sequestration even if emissions
of fossils fuels and other greenhouse gasses are reduced and the
climate system stabilizes. We conclude that modelers need to
account for lag effects in models and in data used for model
testing. Policy makers need to consider lagged responses and
committed changes in the biosphere when developing adaptation
and mitigation strategies.},
