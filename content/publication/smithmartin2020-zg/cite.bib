  abstract = "Abstract Recent findings suggest that tree mortality and
              post-drought recovery of gas exchange can be predicted from loss
              of function within the water transport system. Understanding the
              susceptibility of plants to hydraulic damage requires knowledge
              about the vulnerability of different plant organs to
              stress-induced hydraulic dysfunction. This is particularly
              important in the context of vulnerability segmentation between
              plant tissues which is believed to protect more energetically
              ?costly? tissues, such as woody stems, by sacrificing ?cheaper?
              leaves early under drought conditions. Differences in
              vulnerability segmentation between co-occurring plant species
              could explain divergent behaviours during drought, yet there are
              few studies considering how this characteristic may vary within a
              plant community. Here we investigated community-wide
              vulnerability segmentation by comparing leaf/shoot and stem
              vulnerability in all coexistent dominant canopy and understory
              woody species in a diverse dry sclerophyll woodland community,
              including multiple angiosperms and one gymnosperm. Previously
              published terminal leaf/shoot vulnerability to loss of water
              transport capacity was compared with stem xylem vulnerability to
              embolism measured on the same species at the same site. We
              calculated hydraulic safety margins for stems to determine
              variation in the risk of hydraulic failure during drought among
              species. The xylem of all species was found to be highly
              resistant to hydraulic dysfunction, with only two of the eight
              species exhibiting significantly different vulnerability to the
              overall mean. No evidence of vulnerability segmentation between
              shoots/leaves and stems was found in seven of the eight species.
              Phylogenetically diverse canopy and understory species in this
              evergreen sclerophyll woodland appear to have evolved similar
              strategies of drought resistance, including low xylem
              vulnerability to embolism and general lack of vulnerability
              segmentation. This convergence in hydraulic safety indicates a
              lack of hydraulic niche partitioning in this woodland community.
