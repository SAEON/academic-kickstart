 abstract = {The Cederberg Mountains (Western Cape Province, South Africa)
are located within the Fynbos Biome, which exhibits some of the
highest levels of species richness and endemism in the world.
The region's post-glacial vegetation history, however, remains
largely unknown. Presented here are high resolution pollen and
microcharcoal records spanning the last 15,600years obtained
from the De Rif rock hyrax midden from the Driehoek Valley of
the central Cederberg. In this region, previous pollen studies
have shown muted variability in vegetation community composition
during periods of globally marked climatic variability (e.g. the
last glacial--interglacial transition). In our record, however,
significant changes in vegetation composition are apparent. Most
notably, they indicate a shift from ericaceous/restioid fynbos
(present from 15,600 to 13,300calyr BP) to a brief, but
prominent, development of proteoid fynbos at the beginning of
the Holocene around 11,200calyr BP. This vegetation shift is
associated with increased moisture at the site, and coincides
with reduced fire frequency as indicated by the microcharcoal
record. At 10,400calyr BP, there is a marked reduction in
Protea-type pollen, which is replaced by thicket, characterised
by Dodonaea, which became the dominant arboreal pollen type.
This shift was likely the result of a long relatively fire-free
period coupled with warmer and wetter climates spanning much of
the early Holocene. A brief but marked decrease in water
availability around 8500--8000calyr BP resulted in the strong
decrease of Dodonaea pollen. The vegetation of the mid- to late
Holocene is characterised by the increased occurrence of
Asteraceae and succulent taxa, suggesting substantially drier
conditions. These data give unprecedented insight into the
vegetation dynamics across a period of substantial, rapid
climate change, and while they confirm the presence of fynbos
elements throughout the last 15,600years, the results highlight
significant fluctuations in the vegetation that were triggered
by changes in both climate and fire regimes.},
