 abstract = {Understanding the ecology and evolution of the hyper-diverse
Cape flora is dependent on developing an understanding of its
component parts, best epitomized by the Cape floral clades that
have diversified and are largely endemic to the region. Here we
employ a new dated phylogenetic hypothesis for the sedge genus
Tetraria, one of the smaller Cape floral clades, to develop an
understanding of timing and rates of diversification in the
group. Specifically, we test whether diversification in Tetraria
slowed as the number of extant lineages increased, suggesting
that available ecological niche space has become increasingly
saturated through time. The radiation of Tetraria began
approximately 18million years ago, concordant with that of many
other Cape clades. Diversification rates in the genus showed no
drastic shifts in response to major environmental changes, but
declined as lineage diversity accumulated, indicative of
ecological limitation on speciation rates. This allows the
development of heuristic predictions about the composition of
Tetraria assemblages at various spatial scales, and suggests
that closely related species should either be ecologically
differentiated or have non-overlapping geographic distributions.
The question of whether ecological limitation of diversity is a
common phenomenon in other Cape lineages has important
implications for our understanding of the evolution and ecology
of the contemporary Cape flora as a whole.},
