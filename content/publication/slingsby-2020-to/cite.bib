  abstract = "Managing fire, water, biodiversity and carbon stocks can greatly
              benefit from early warning of changes in the state of vegetation.
              While near-real time tools to detect forest change based on
              satellite remote sensing exist, these ecosystems have relatively
              stable natural vegetation dynamics. Open (i.e. non-forest)
              ecosystems like grasslands, savannas and shrublands are more
              challenging as they show complex natural dynamics due to factors
              such as fire, postfire recovery, greater contribution of bare
              soil to observed vegetation indices, as well as high sensitivity
              to rainfall and strong seasonality. Tools to aid the management
              of open ecosystems are desperately required as they dominate much
              of the globe and harbour substantial biodiversity and carbon. We
              present an innovative approach that overcomes the difficulties
              posed by open ecosystems by using a spatio-temporal hierarchical
              Bayesian model that uses data on climate, topography, soils and
              fire history to generate ecological forecasts of the expected
              land surface signal under natural conditions. This allows us to
              monitor and detect abrupt or gradual changes in the state of an
              ecosystem in near-real time by identifying areas where the
              observed vegetation signal has deviated from the expected natural
              variation. We apply our approach to a case study from the
              hyperdiverse fire-dependent African shrubland, the fynbos of the
              Cape Floristic Region, a Global Biodiversity Hotspot and UNESCO
              World Heritage Site that faces a number of threats to vegetation
              health and ecosystem function. The case study demonstrates that
              our approach is useful for identifying a range of change agents
              such as fire, alien plant species invasions, drought, pathogen
              outbreaks and clearing of vegetation. We describe and provide our
              full workflow, including an interactive web application. Our
              approach is highly versatile, allowing us to collect data on the
              impacts of change agents for research in ecology and earth system
              science, and to predict aspects of ecosystem structure and
              function such as biomass, fire return interval and the influence
              of vegetation on hydrology.",
