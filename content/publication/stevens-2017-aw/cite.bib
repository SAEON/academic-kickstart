 abstract = {Tropical savannas are a globally extensive biome prone to rapid
vegetation change in response to changing environmental
conditions. Via a meta-analysis, we quantified savanna woody
vegetation change spanning the last century. We found a global
trend of woody encroachment that was established prior the 1980s.
However, there is critical regional variation in the magnitude of
encroachment. Woody cover is increasing most rapidly in the
remaining uncleared savannas of South America, most likely due to
fire suppression and land fragmentation. In contrast, Australia
has experienced low rates of encroachment. When accounting for
land use, African savannas have a mean rate annual woody cover
increase two and a half times that of Australian savannas. In
Africa, encroachment occurs across multiple land uses and is
accelerating over time. In Africa and Australia, rising
atmospheric CO2 , changing land management and rainfall are
likely causes. We argue that the functional traits of each woody
flora, specifically the N-fixing ability and architecture of
woody plants, are critical to predicting encroachment over the
next century and that African savannas are at high risk of
widespread vegetation change.},
