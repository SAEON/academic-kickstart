 abstract = {Abstract The identification of research questions with high
relevance for biodiversity conservation is an important step
towards designing more effective policies and management actions,
and to better allocate funding among alternative conservation
options. However, the identification of priority questions may be
influenced by regional differences in biodiversity threats and
social contexts, and to variations in the perceptions and
interests of different stakeholders. Here we describe the results
of a prioritization exercise involving six types of stakeholders
from the Mediterranean biome, which includes several biodiversity
hotspots spread across five regions of the planet (Europe,
Africa, North and South America, and Australia). We found great
heterogeneity across regions and stakeholder types in the
priority topics identified and disagreement among the priorities
of research scientists and other stakeholders. However,
governance, climate change, and public participation issues were
key topics in most regions. We conclude that the identification
of research priorities should be targeted in a way that
integrates the spectrum of stakeholder interests, potential
funding sources and regional needs, and that further development
of interdisciplinary studies is required. The key questions
identified here provide a basis to identify priorities for
research funding aligned with biodiversity conservation needs in
this biome.},
