 abstract = {Abstract Aim The Hutchinsonian niche is a foundational concept in
ecology and evolutionary biology that describes fundamental
characteristics of any species: the global maximum population
growth rate (rmax); the niche optimum (the environment for which
rmax is reached); and the niche width (the environmental range
for which intrinsic population growth rates are positive). We
examine whether these characteristics are related to inter- and
intraspecific variation in functional traits. Location Cape
Floristic Region, South Africa. Time period Present day. Major
taxa studied Twenty-six plant species (Proteaceae). Methods We
measured leaf, plant-architectural and seed traits across species
geographical ranges. We then examined how species-mean traits are
related to demographically derived niche characteristics of rmax,
in addition to niche optima and widths in five environmental
dimensions, and how intraspecific trait variation is related to
niche widths. Results Interspecific trait variation generally
exceeded range-wide intraspecific trait variation. Species-mean
trait values were associated with variation in rmax (R2 = 0.27)
but were more strongly related to niche optima (mean R2 = 0.56).
These relationships generally matched trait?environment
associations described in the literature. Both species-mean
traits and intraspecific trait variability were strongly related
to niche widths (R2 = 0.66 and 0.59, respectively). Moreover,
niche widths increased with intraspecific trait variability.
Overall, the different niche characteristics were associated with
few, largely non-overlapping sets of traits. Main conclusions Our
study relating functional traits to Hutchinsonian niches
demonstrates that key demographic properties of species relate to
few traits with relatively strong effects. Our results further
support the hypothesis that intraspecific trait variation
increases species niche widths. Given that niche characteristics
were related to distinct sets of traits, different aspects of
environmental change might affect axes of trait variation
independently. Trait-based studies of Hutchinsonian niches thus
yield important insights into the mechanisms shaping functional
biodiversity, which should reinforce the role of traits in
functional biogeography.},
