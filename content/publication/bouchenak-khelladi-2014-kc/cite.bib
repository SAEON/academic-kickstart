 abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The radiation of a lineage and its rise to
ecological dominance are distinct phenomena and driven by
different processes. For example, paleoecological data has been
used to show that the Cretaceous angiosperm radiation did not
coincide with their rise to dominance. Using a phylogenetic
approach, we here explored the evolution of C4 grasses and
evaluated whether the diversification of this group and its rise
to ecological dominance in the late Miocene were decoupled.
METHODS: We assembled a matrix including 675 grass species of the
PACMAD clade and 2784 characters (ITS and ndhF) to run a
molecular dating analysis using three fossils as reference
calibrations. We coded species as C3 vs. C4 and reconstructed
ancestral states under maximum likelihood. We used the program
BiSSE to test whether rates of diversification are correlated
with photosynthetic pathway and whether the radiation of C4
lineages preceded or coincided with their rise to ecological
dominance from âˆ¼10 Ma. KEY RESULTS: C4 grass lineages first
originated around 35 Ma at the time of the Eocene-Oligocene
transition. Accelerated diversification of C4 lineages did not
coincide with their rise to ecological dominance. CONCLUSIONS:
C4-dominated grasslands have expanded only since the Late Miocene
and Pliocene. The initial diversification of their biotic
elements can be tracked back as far as the Eocene-Oligocene
transition. We suggest that shifts in taxonomic diversification
and ecological dominance were stimulated by different factors, as
in the case of the early angiosperms in the Cretaceous.},
