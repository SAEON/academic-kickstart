 abstract = {The extent of the savannah biome is expected to be profoundly
altered by climatic change and increasing atmospheric CO2
concentrations. Contrasting projections are given when using
different modelling approaches to estimate future distributions.
Furthermore, biogeographic variation within savannahs in plant
function and structure is expected to lead to divergent responses
to global change. Hence the use of a single model with a single
savannah tree type will likely lead to biased projections. Here
we compare and contrast projections of South American, African
and Australian savannah distributions from the physiologically
based Thornley transport resistance statistical distribution
model (TTR-SDM)-and three versions of a dynamic vegetation model
(DVM) designed and parametrized separately for specific
continents. We show that attempting to extrapolate any
continent-specific model globally biases projections. By 2070,
all DVMs generally project a decrease in the extent of savannahs
at their boundary with forests, whereas the TTR-SDM projects a
decrease in savannahs at their boundary with aridlands and
grasslands. This difference is driven by forest and woodland
expansion in response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations in
DVMs, unaccounted for by the TTR-SDM. We suggest that the most
suitable models of the savannah biome for future development are
individual-based dynamic vegetation models designed for specific
biogeographic regions.This article is part of the themed issue

conservation'.},
