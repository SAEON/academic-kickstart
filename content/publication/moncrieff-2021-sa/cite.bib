 abstract = {Abstract Long-term catchment experiments from South Africa have
demonstrated that afforestation of grasslands and shrublands
significantly reduces surface-water runoff. These results have
guided the country's forestry policy and the implementation of a
national Invasive Alien Plant (IAP) control programme for the
past few decades. Unfortunately, woody IAP densities continue to
increase, compounding existing threats to water security from
population growth and climatic change. Decision makers need
defensible estimates of the impacts of afforestation or
invasions on runoff to weigh up alternative land use options, or
guide investment of limited resources into ecosystem restoration
through IAP clearing versus engineering-based water-augmentation
schemes. Existing attempts to extrapolate the impacts observed
in catchment afforestation experiments to broad-scale IAP
impacts give no indication of uncertainty. Globally, the
uncertainty inherent in the results from paired-catchment
experiments is seldom propagated into subsequent analyses making
use of these data. We present a fully reproducible Bayesian
model that propagates uncertainty from input data to final
estimates of changes in streamflow when extrapolating from
catchment experiments to broader landscapes. We apply our model
to South Africa's catchment experiment data, estimating
streamflow losses to plantations and analogous plant invasions
in the catchments of southwestern South Africa, including
uncertainty. We estimate that regional streamflow is reduced by
304 million m3 or 4.14% annually as a result of IAPs, with an
upper estimate of 408 million m3 (5.54%) and a lower estimate
of 267 million m3 (3.63%). Our model quantifies uncertainty
associated with all parameters and their contribution to overall
uncertainty, helping guide future research needs. Acknowledging
and quantifying inherent uncertainty enables more defensible
decisions regarding water resource management.},
