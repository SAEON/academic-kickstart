 abstract = {Despite decades of study, the relative importance of niche-based
versus neutral processes in community assembly remains largely
ambiguous. Recent work suggests niche-based processes are more
easily detectable at coarser spatial scales, while neutrality
dominates at finer scales. Analyses of functional traits with
multi-year multi-site biodiversity inventories may provide deeper
insights into assembly processes and the effects of spatial
scale. We examined associations between community composition,
species functional traits, and environmental conditions for plant
communities in the Kouga-Baviaanskloof region, an area within
South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR) containing high
$Î±$ and ? diversity. This region contains strong climatic
gradients and topographic heterogeneity, and is comprised of
distinct vegetation classes with varying fire histories, making
it an ideal location to assess the role of niche-based
environmental filtering on community composition by examining how
traits vary with environment. We combined functional trait
measurements for over 300 species with observations from
vegetation surveys carried out in 1991/1992 and repeated in
2011/2012. We applied redundancy analysis, quantile regression,
and null model tests to examine trends in species turnover and
functional traits along environmental gradients in space and
through time. Functional trait values were weakly associated with
most spatial environmental gradients and only showed trends with
respect to vegetation class and time since fire. However, survey
plots showed greater compositional and functional stability
through time than expected based on null models. Taken together,
we found clear evidence for functional distinctions between
vegetation classes, suggesting strong environmental filtering at
this scale, most likely driven by fire dynamics. In contrast,
there was little evidence of filtering effects along
environmental gradients within vegetation classes, suggesting
that assembly processes are largely neutral at this scale, likely
the result of very high functional redundancy among species in
the regional species pool.},
