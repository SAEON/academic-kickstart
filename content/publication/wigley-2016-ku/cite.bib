 abstract = {Establishing trade‐offs among traits and the degree to which
they covary along environmental gradients has become a key focal
point in the effort to develop community ecology into a
predictive science. While there is evidence for these
relationships across global data sets, they are often too broad
in scale and do not consider the particularities of local to
regional species pools. This decreases their usefulness for
developing predictive models at scales relevant for conservation
and management. We tested for trade‐offs …},
