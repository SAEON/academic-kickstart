 abstract = {Remote sensing is revolutionizing the way we study forests, and
recent technological advances mean we are now able - for the
first time - to identify and measure the crown dimensions of
individual trees from airborne imagery. Yet to make full use of
these data for quantifying forest carbon stocks and dynamics, a
new generation of allometric tools which have tree height and
crown size at their centre are needed. Here, we compile a global
database of 108753 trees for which stem diameter, height and
crown diameter have all been measured, including 2395 trees
harvested to measure aboveground biomass. Using this database, we
develop general allometric models for estimating both the
diameter and aboveground biomass of trees from attributes which
can be remotely sensed - specifically height and crown diameter.
We show that tree height and crown diameter jointly quantify the
aboveground biomass of individual trees and find that a single
equation predicts stem diameter from these two variables across
the world's forests. These new allometric models provide an
intuitive way of integrating remote sensing imagery into
large-scale forest monitoring programmes and will be of key
importance for parameterizing the next generation of dynamic
vegetation models.},
