This section is a work in progress. We hope to add a series of tutorials for how to access and analyze SAEON datasets and other useful resources, mostly using the R programming language. We've also included a section on [R basics](/docs/learningr/) to help you get familiar with the language. Note that most tutorials will include an overview of the data and details for accessing them, so we hope they will still be useful even if you don't use R.
