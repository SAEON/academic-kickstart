## Getting started

This set of tutorials includes:
* a discussion/motivation as to why you should learn R if you are working in environmental science, including a list of resources to help you get going
* two demonstrations of the kinds of things you can do in R. These show the code and use freely available data so you can follow along by running the code line by line on your own machine (after you have installed R)
