I am a plant ecologist exploring the relationships between plant performance and the environment as a basis for understanding biodiversity responses to ongoing global change. I study range-wide demographic and functional trait variation of serotinous Proteaceae in the Cape Floristic Region. My postdoctoral research at SAEON, working with Dr Jasper Slingsby, focuses on using long-term monitoring to quantify climate-induced changes in the demography of several Proteaceae species. For more details on my research see https://fynbosser.wordpress.com.
