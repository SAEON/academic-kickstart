The Baviaanskloof and Kouga mountains lie on the far eastern portion of the Fynbos and has interesting climatic, floristic and ecological differences from the rest of the Biome. This region also sees a convergence of biomes, with rapid transitions between Fynbos, Grasslands, Forest, Albany Thicket and Nama Karoo across differences in soil type, topography and disturbance regime. This makes it a fascinating area for studying biome boundaries and the potential for shifts between biome states. It also encompasses a Strategic Water Source Area and is critical for bulk water supply to the city of Port Elizabeth, smaller towns and the surrounding agricultural areas.

The Fynbos Node's research in this area largely revolves around hydrological monitoring and modelling to explore the impacts of land use and land cover change and the potential benefits of restorative activities. We also maintain a set of long term monitoring plots first established in 1991/2 and resurveyed in 2011/2. See [Aiello-Lammens et al. 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.01945) for more details.
