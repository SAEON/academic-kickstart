The SAEON Graduate Student Network is a student run initiative supported by SAEON that aims to build and promote the sustainability and academic excellence of long term environmental research among post-graduate students in South Africa through interactions with SAEON. 'Graduate student' refers to students currently involved in either part-time or full-time Honours, Masters, Doctoral or Post-Doctoral research projects that are in line with SAEONâ€™s research programmes. You can find more at the [website](http://gsn.dirisa.org/) or [Facebook page](https://web.facebook.com/SAEONGSN2016).
