The SAEON Fynbos Node forms part of the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), a business unit within the National Research Foundation.  The Department of Science and Innovation established SAEON to conduct long term environmental observation and promote an informed and timely response to global change. 

SAEON is countrywide, with "Nodes" encompassing the major terrestrial, coastal and oceanic environments. Its activities cover the entire research-development-innovation value chain ranging from collecting, processing, archiving and interpreting data; developing data products and services; and interfacing with end users that include policy makers and environmental managers.

SAEON works in collaboration with government agencies, universities, research institutions, industrial partners and civil society.
