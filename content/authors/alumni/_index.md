### Postdocs

[**Martina Treurnicht**](https://fynbosser.wordpress.com), 2019-2021, explored range-wide demographic and functional trait variation of serotinous Proteaceae, focusing on using long-term monitoring to quantify climate-induced changes in their demography. Since May 2021, Martina is based as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Conservation Ecology, Stellenbosch University, working on understanding abiotic and biotic drivers of demography, niches and geographical ranges of Cape Proteaceae.

**Brigitte Melly**, 2017-2020, worked on understanding the hydrological dynamics of the wetland systems along the Heuningness River system and its tributaries, and their vulnerability to global change. 

**Glenn Moncrieff**, 2015-2017, worked on various projects relating to Dynamic Vegetation Models, developing biodiversity monitoring tools based on remote-sensing, and scaling up between vegetation community data and broader ecosystem properties.

**Nicola Stevens**, 2014-2015, started a postdoc working on developing Fynbos biodiversity monitoring tools based on remote-sensing and scaling up between vegetation community data and broader ecosystem properties.

**Christopher Trisos**, 2014-2015, worked on dispersal rates in *Proteaceae*.

**Genevieve Thompson**, 2012-2014, worked on building a genus-level phylogeny of the plants of South Africa to explore patterns of phylogenetic diversity and the evolutionary transitions required to cross biome boundaries in South Africa.
