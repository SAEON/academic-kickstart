I take care of administration at the Node and help keep things running smoothly. Iâ€™ve been in administration support for a number of years, supporting projects and office teams. I also have a BEd degree and taught at an Ambleside school. I enjoy spending time with my family and long walks in green fields and ocean fronts.
