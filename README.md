# [SAEON Fynbos Node Website](https://fynbos.saeon.ac.za/)

To build this website you need a working version of R with library(blogdown) installed. You are also likely to need to install many of the packages used in the Data Skills posts and some of the "Site" (authors) and dashboard pages. While all the data for analyses etc are packaged in the repo, you will need to change some file paths as these have to be hard coded for various reasons. Some of these file include:
/academic-kickstart/content/authors/jonkershoek/_index.Rmd
/academic-kickstart/content/dashboards/efteon/index.Rmd
/academic-kickstart/content/dashboards/catchment/index.Rmarkdown
/academic-kickstart/content/docs/learningR/demo-1-weather.Rmarkdown
/academic-kickstart/content/docs/learningR/demo-2-biodiversity.Rmarkdown

... I may have missed some...
